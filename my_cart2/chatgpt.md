Sure! Here's a structured approach to developing your cart application using Context API.

---

### **App Features**
1. **Product List**:
   - Display a list of products with name, price, and an "Add to Cart" button.
2. **Cart Management**:
   - Add, update, and remove items in the cart.
   - Show a summary of items in the cart, including quantities and prices.
   - Display the total cost of all items in the cart.
3. **State Persistence**:
   - Save the cart state in `localStorage` to persist the data across page reloads.
4. **Optional Filters**:
   - Allow filtering or sorting of products (e.g., by price or category).
5. **Responsive UI**:
   - Ensure a clean, user-friendly design for both desktop and mobile devices.

### **Architecture**

#### 1. **State Management**
- Use **Context API** to manage the global state for the cart.
- Implement a **reducer** pattern to handle actions like `ADD_TO_CART`, `REMOVE_FROM_CART`, `UPDATE_QUANTITY`, and `CLEAR_CART`.

#### 2. **Components**
- **App**:
  - Main wrapper for the application.
  - Includes the `CartContextProvider` to make cart state available to all child components.
- **ProductList**:
  - Displays available products.
  - Fetches product data either from a local file or an API.
  - Contains an "Add to Cart" button for each product.
- **Cart**:
  - Displays items in the cart with their quantities and prices.
  - Includes controls to increase/decrease quantities and remove items.
  - Shows the total price of the cart.
- **CartItem** (Optional):
  - Represents a single item in the cart.
  - Handles the logic for updating quantity or removing the item.
- **Header**:
  - Displays a link to the cart and the total number of items in it.
  - Could include navigation links for other pages or features.

---

### **State Flow**

1. **Global Context**:
   - Use `createContext` to share the cart state (`cartItems`) and dispatch function across components.
2. **Reducer**:
   - Define a reducer function to manage state transitions. Example actions:
     - `ADD_TO_CART`: Add an item to the cart or increase its quantity if already present.
     - `REMOVE_FROM_CART`: Remove an item by its ID.
     - `UPDATE_QUANTITY`: Update the quantity of a specific item.
     - `CLEAR_CART`: Reset the cart to an empty state.

---

### **User Flow**

1. **Adding to Cart**:
   - User clicks "Add to Cart" on a product.
   - The product is added to the cart state via the reducer.
   - The total number of items updates dynamically.
2. **Viewing the Cart**:
   - User navigates to the cart page.
   - The cart context is accessed to display items, quantities, and total cost.
3. **Updating Cart**:
   - User can increase/decrease quantities or remove items.
   - The cart updates in real-time.
4. **State Persistence**:
   - Use `localStorage` to save the cart state whenever it changes.
   - On page reload, initialize the cart state from `localStorage`.

2. **API Integration**:
   - Fetch product data from an API instead of hardcoding it.
   - Save and retrieve the cart state from a backend.
3. **Discounts and Coupons**:
   - Add functionality for applying promo codes.
4. **Checkout Page**:
   - Implement a checkout flow with order summary, user details, and payment integration.
5. **Category Filters**:
   - Allow filtering products by categories (e.g., electronics, clothing).
